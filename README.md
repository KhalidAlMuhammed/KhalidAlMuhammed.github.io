# Khalid Al Muhammed

Hey there! I'm Khalid, a software engineer with a knack for turning coffee into code. When Iâ€™m not busy building ML models, you can find me perfecting my left hook and right cross in the ring. I've got a couple of academic awards and hackathons under my belt, but my real claim to fame is my passion for tackling new challenges with a positive impact. Columbia University is my current playground, and I'm always ready for the next tech adventure!
